I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/kana/chapter1kana.rpy", line 466, in script
    "(Notif WA)" play audio "audio/ReceiveText.ogg"
Exception: Say has image attributes ('play', 'audio'), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
